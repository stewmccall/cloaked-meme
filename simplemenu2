//  This is a modified version of a simple menu program found on page 61 of Introduction to C#
//  The original had no check to see if the menu option was within the range of those listed
//  and no error message if the user made a choice outside the range.
//  This was added into program to reflect the need to control.
//  a continuous loop is set up to keep the routine running until the word end is entered at the end of the routine
//  rather than just 'enter' to end.
//  comments documenting the flow program were added that were not present in the original to explain how it words.
//  revised a change to the routine to verify that the option is within the range and make sure that entry is a numeric entry
//  added the option for decaf (to meet the revision that followed.
